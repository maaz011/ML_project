Used Car Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on several features such as make, model, year, mileage, transmission type, and fuel type. By training machine learning models on a dataset, this project helps estimate the price of a used car when provided with relevant details. Additionally, it provides a user-friendly web interface to input the car details and get a predicted price.

Project Overview
This project is structured into two main components:

Backend (Machine Learning Model): A regression-based model that predicts used car prices. The model uses popular machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Lasso Regression to predict the price based on input features.

Frontend (Web Interface): A Flask-based web application that allows users to input car details and receive a price prediction. The interface is built to be simple and easy to use, guiding users through the process of inputting necessary car attributes.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Anaconda (for dependency management)
Steps to Install
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/used-car-price-prediction.git
cd used-car-price-prediction
Set Up a Virtual Environment: Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

bash
Copy code
conda create --name car-price-prediction python=3.8
conda activate car-price-prediction
Install Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application: Start the Flask web application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Now, you can access the application through your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Technologies Used
This project utilizes several key technologies:

Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (including Lasso, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Regressors)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for styling the web interface
Data Analysis: Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations
Dataset: The model is trained using a dataset of used car listings, cars-dataset.csv, sourced from Kaggle.
Features
Car Price Prediction: Users can input specific details of a used car, including make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more, and the app will predict the carâ€™s price.

Multiple Machine Learning Models: The system uses multiple regression models to predict prices, giving a reliable output by comparing results from different models.

Simple Web Interface: The user interface is built using Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap, making it easy for users to interact with the app and get quick results.

Real-time Results: As soon as the user submits the car details, the predicted price is displayed instantly.

Usage
Run the Flask App: After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, start the Flask server:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Web App: Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Input Car Details: In the input form, fill in the required car attributes, such as:

Make
Model
Year of manufacture
Mileage
Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, etc.)
Transmission type (Manual or Automatic)
Get the Prediction: After submitting the form, the predicted car price will appear on the screen.

Model Selection & Training
This project uses several machine learning algorithms to predict the price of used cars:

Linear Regression: A simple linear approach that predicts the price based on the linear relationship between car features.

Decision Tree Regression: A non-linear regression method that splits data into subsets based on decision rules, making it useful for complex relationships between features.

Random Forest Regression: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It is particularly robust in real-world data.

Lasso Regression: A linear regression technique that uses L1 regularization to handle high-dimensional data and avoid overfitting.

The model is trained on a dataset of used cars with various features. It is evaluated using standard metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to measure prediction accuracy.
